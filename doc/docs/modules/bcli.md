# BCLI
#### Beautiful Command Line Interface

This module is perfect for you if you wanted a easy and working solution to Nice Looking Command Line Interface.
Somewhat like this

![demo.bcli](../images/demo.bcli.PNG)

The above is generated by this code
```python
from denverapi import bcli

cli = bcli.new_cli()

cli.info("This is a test")
cli.good("Works Well")
cli.bad("Might be not as expected")
cli.run("But let's run this")

print("\n\n")

# Number Adder
number = cli.input("Number 1 >")
number2 = cli.input("Number 2 >")

# Lets validate them
if number.isnumeric() and number2.isnumeric():
    cli.good("All the numbers are valid")
else:
    cli.bad("The numbers are supposed to be Integers")
    raise SystemExit(1)

# Lets convert them to integers
cli.info("Conversion to integers started")
number = int(number)
cli.run("Number Converted")
number2 = int(number2)
cli.run("Number 2 Converted")
cli.good("All numbers Converted to integer")

# Lets add them
try:
    result = number + number2
    cli.good("Numbers added")
except:
    cli.bad("Numbers could not be added")
    raise SystemExit(1)

cli.info("Result is", result)
```

Using bcli is easy for that you have to first import the module

```python
from denverapi import bcli
```

Then you will have to create a command line interface

```python
cli = bcli.new_cli()
```

Then you can use `info`, `good`, `run`, `bad` functions. Also, you can use the `input` function.
After all of the combination from the above you can easily create scripts using bcli.
