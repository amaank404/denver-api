# denver
Denver API for Python

This API is specifically disigned for python developers who want to use
advanced utilities but without coding much. The API requires you to
have minimum Python 3.8

## sockets (script)
This script contains the complete environment for parsing server scripts. The server script format is new
and cannot be found out anywhere, therefore usage guide will be published with the denver API documentation.

## Installation
The package can be installed by
```commandline
pip install pydenver
```
and upgraded by
```commandline
pip install --upgrade pydenver
```

## Documentation
Documentation for denver can be found out at [this page](https://xcodz-dot.github.io/denverdocs) (*currently in progress and may not be visible for some time*).
Also Documentation provided with this project can be used but you will have to install mkdocs
by the following command
```commandline
pip install mkdocs
```
or if you already have then you can upgrade it by following command
```commandline
pip install --upgrade mkdocs
```
After installation cd to `./docs/` and run this command `mkdocs build` or if you want to edit `mkdocs serve` and then you can edit any file (any file editid during `mkdocs serve` will be reflected on server every time you save a file)
