        Denver API for Python
        
        This API is specifically designed for python developers who want to use
        advanced utilities but without coding much. The API requires you to
        have minimum Python 3.8
        
        ## sockets (script)
        This script contains the complete environment for parsing server scripts. The server script format is new
        and cannot be found out anywhere, therefore usage guide will be published with the denver API documentation.
        
        ## colored text (denver.ctext)
        Colored console output have been a problem since long but here at denver API, we provide
        cross-platform colored console output in almost any console. we also provide emulated
        print and input function with extra keyword arguments for coloring and customizing. the
        default print and input function of you code can be switched out to these one by
        ```python
        from denver import ctext
        
        print = ctext.print
        input = ctext.input
        
        # You can do the same with input
        print("Hello", "World in colored", "text", fore="green", back="white", style="bright")
        print("Hello", "World in simple", "environment")
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        The package can be installed by
        ```commandline
        pip install pydenver
        ```
        and upgraded by

        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        Documentation for denver can be found out at [this page](https://xcodz-dot.github.io/denverdocs) (*currently in progress
        and may not be visible for some time*).
        Also Documentation provided with this project can be used but you will have to install mkdocs
        by the following command
        ```commandline
        pip install mkdocs
        ```
        or if you already have then you can upgrade it by following command
        ```commandline
        pip install --upgrade mkdocs
        ```
        After installation cd to `./docs/` and run this command `mkdocs build` or if you want to edit `mkdocs serve` and then 
        you can edit any file (any file edited during `mkdocs serve` will be reflected on server every time you save a file)
